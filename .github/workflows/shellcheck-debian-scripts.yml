# Note: No need to specify the shell option in the shellcheck command.
# These linted scripts are for ubuntu so the !/bin/sh (i.e. system shell) shebang at the top of these scripts will point to bash.
# So no need to pass the shell option to the shellcheck command as shellcheck will read the shebang at the top of the file (system shell) so will use the
# system shell of the runner (bash because the runner is using Ubuntu images)
